# ESMFold - Evolutionary-scale prediction of atomic-level protein structure with a language model

This repository project is a python base application which utilize the ESMFold model to predict protein structures. ESMfold is an end-to-end single sequence protein structure predictor based on the ESM-2 language model. Data model and the application is based on works by metaAI ESM project.
