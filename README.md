# ESMFold - Evolutionary-scale prediction of atomic-level protein structure with a language model
This repository contains a Qstreamlit python application to utalize the ESMFold model to predict protein structres given the protien sequance. ESMfold is an end-to-end single sequence protein structure predictor based on the ESM-2 language model. The model and this app is based on Meta AI & ESMfold.
